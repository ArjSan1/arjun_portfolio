    <span class="lb">Covid-19 has taken many lives from the world. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost in the US alone, proving to be a problem physically and mentally.
        In fact, hospitals are now receiving too many patients to handle, leading to a lack of care for many patients.
        As a result of this epidemic, my teammate and I have decided to create a machine learning model that can take COVID-19 chest X-RAYS,
         and return a percentage probability of the patient with that X-RAY having COVID. This has a great amount of applications, such as automation
         so that nurses do not have to manually scrape hundreds of X-RAY files at a time.
