    <span class="lb">With Mentis, individuals can journal to themselves as a form of self-reflection; the journal will then use NLP in tandem with sentiment analysis to
         detect the range of emotions, and store the sentiment value in a database for easy access for visualization and sharing purposes. The user can then decide whether they are
         interested in easily sharing their mood levels with their therapist with the click of a button, protecting the user's personal journals while still sharing facts about their wellbeing to
          their therapists, prompting action if need be. This will allow therapists, for example, see trends of negative data, and then use that data to start a plan to help the client.
